Many appeared to have been trapped in the hold when it capsized.\r\n\r\nBy late in the evening, the Libyan coast guard rescued around 201, of which 147 were brought to a detention facility for illegal migrants in Sabratha, west of Tripoli, the official said, asking not to be named.\r\n\r\nAnother local official and a journalist based in Zuwara confirmed the sinking but also had no information on casualties.\r\n\r\nThe migrants on board had been from sub-Saharan Africa, Pakistan, Syria, Morocco and Bangladesh, the security official said.\r\n\r\nThe Italian coast guard, which has been coordinating rescue operations with the European Union off the Libyan coast, could not immediately confirm a sinking.\r\n\r\nLibya''s coast guard has very limited capabilities, relying on small inflatables, tug boats and fishing vessels.\r\n\r\nZuwara, Libya''s most western town located near the Tunisian border, is a major launchpad for smugglers shipping migrants to Italy.\r\n\r\nLibya has turned into a transit route for migrants fleeing conflict and poverty to make it to Europe. Cross-border smuggler networks exploit the country''s lawlessness and chaos to bring Syrians into Libya via Egypt or nationals of sub-Saharan countries via Niger, Sudan and Chad.\r\n\r\nMore than 2,300 people have died this year in attempts to reach Europe by boat, compared with 3,279 during the whole of last year, according to the International Organization for Migration.\r\n\r\nAs many as 50 refugees were found dead in a parked truck in Austria near the Hungarian border on Thursday, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the discovery had shaken European leaders discussing the migrant crisis at a Balkans summit.\r\n\r\nLibya has been struggling to cope with an influx of migrants, putting them in overcrowded makeshift detention facilities such as schools or military barracks where they live in poor conditions lacking medical care.\r\n\r\nThe North African country used to deport migrants it caught but with fighting between armed groups having cut off land border crossings to Niger, Algeria and Chad many stay months or years in detention facilities.\r\n<html><body><div class="fb-comments" data-href="http://localhost/newsportal/Newsshow.php?page_n=5" data-width="1000" data-numposts="1"></div></html></body>', 0),

However, the rule-making body agreed only to consider an end to the automatic suspension.\r\n\r\nPlatini is against the use of goal-line technology, which Fifa employs in its tournaments, and prefers the use of so-called additional assistant referees, one on each goal-line, to spot penalty-area infringements.\r\n\r\nFifa has not adopted the system and Platini has mockingly said that was because it was not Fifa chief Sepp Blatter''s idea.\r\n\r\nMore countries\r\n\r\nPlatini''s proposals on the World Cup could include expansion of the finals from the current 32 teams, the source said.\r\n\r\nAs Uefa president, he has already overseen an increase in the number of countries at the European championship finals from 16 to 24, starting from next year''s tournament in France.\r\n\r\nThe move has been criticised for diluting the strength of competition, especially after a successful Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine where 16 seemed to be the ideal number.\r\n\r\nPlatini is seen as the front-runner in the bid to replace Blatter who will relinquish his mandate at the Feb 26 election.\r\n\r\nThe source said the Frenchman wants to take his time over his manifesto and added he would travel widely from October.\r\n\r\nSoccer''s world governing body has been plagued by allegations of corruption for years.\r\n\r\nIt was thrown into further turmoil in May when US prosecutors indicted nine soccer officials and five marketing and broadcasting company executives over alleged offences, including fraud, money-laundering and racketeering\r\n<html><body><div class="fb-comments" data-href="http://localhost/newsportal/Newsshow.php?page_n=6" data-width="1000" data-numposts="1"></div></html></body>\r\n            \r\n', 0),

People are talking about the defence but last season we started off conceding a lot of goals, too," Courtois said.\r\n\r\n"Maybe we still need to find the right balance between attacking and defending.

The size of its economy, its growth rate and our expectation of continued strong economic growth support this assessment," it said in Tuesday''s report.\r\n \r\n"India''s GDP of $2,051 billion places it in top decile of all Moody''s-rated sovereigns and its investment ratio is also at the higher end among rated sovereigns. The economy''s scale insulates it to some degree against global or domestic trends that could otherwise hurt growth."\r\n \r\nIt felt, India as an importer will benefit from a low commodity price environment, and its reliance on domestic demand for GDP growth shielded the economy, somewhat, from the subdued outlook for global growth.\r\n \r\nThe Moody''s report comes a day after the Bombay Stock Exchange''s steepest ever fall on Monday, of 1624.51 points or 5.94 percent.

The numbers traveling through the Balkans have soared in recent weeks, with 3,000 crossing into Macedonia daily from Greece then whisked by train and bus north to Serbia and beyond.\r\n\r\nThe chief commissioner of Hungarian police, Karoly Papp, said police were readying six special border patrol units of an initial 2,106 officers, equipped with helicopters, horses and dogs, to be sent in depending on the situation on the Serbian border.\r\n\r\n“They don’t have and will not get an order to shoot,” Papp told a news conference.\r\n\r\nIn Roszke, the police spokesman said some 200 migrants at the reception center where unrest flared had refused to be fingerprinted.\r\n\r\nAlmost all hope to reach the more affluent countries of northern and western Europe such as Germany and Sweden, but being fingerprinted in Hungary means that, under EU rules, they risk being returned to Budapest as their official point of entry into the 28-nation EU.\r\n\r\nEXHAUSTED CHILDREN\r\n\r\n“My brother is in Sweden,” said one migrant, who declined to be named. “He told me to chop my hands off rather than give my fingerprints to the Hungarians.

To be part of the civilized world."\r\n\r\nEmbroiled in a debilitating economic crisis, Greece has taken to ferrying mainly Syrian migrants from its overwhelmed islands to Athens. Some 50,000 hit Greek shores by boat from Turkey in July alone.\r\n\r\nSome European leaders have complained that Greece fails to register its arrivals, meaning their first recognized point of entry is often elsewhere and Athens does not risk them being sent back.\r\n<html><body><div class="fb-comments" data-href="http://localhost/newsportal/Newsshow.php?page_n=23" data-width="1000" data-numposts="1"></div></html></body>\r\n\r\n\r\n', 0),
(24, 'china cuts', 'China cuts rates, reserve ratio to aid economy as stocks sink', '<img style="float:right; width=76%;margin-left:10px" src="images/economy.jpg">\r\nThe moves came after Chinese stocks tumbled again on Tuesday, as investors despaired at the lack of policy action from Beijing in response to recent data suggesting the downturn in the world''s second-largest economy was deepening.\r\n\r\nThe People''s Bank of China (PBOC) said it was cutting the one-year benchmark bank lending rate by 25 basis points to 4.6 percent, cutting one-year benchmark deposit rates by the same amount, and reducing reserve requirements (RRR) by 50 basis points to 18 percent for most big banks.\r\n\r\nMajor Chinese stock indexes nosedived more than 7 percent on Tuesday, hitting their lowest levels since December, following a more than 8 percent plunge on Monday.\r\n\r\nThe slump had resumed last week despite Beijing''s efforts to arrest a 30 percent crash earlier in the summer with hundreds of billions of dollars of state-backed share purchases.\r\n\r\nThis time, the government appeared to be sitting on its hands until Tuesday''s response, which aimed more at shoring up economic fundamentals than underpinning stocks.\r\n\r\n"Although this has some elements of giving comfort to the market, this is more about giving a real boost to the real economy so the government can continue to have its 7 percent growth rate fulfilled," said Liu Li-Gang, China economist at ANZ Bank in Hong Kong.\r\n\r\nLiu said the RRR cut was the most significant element of the PBOC action, as it would inject 650 billion yuan ($101 billion), into the economy and ease concerns of a "hard landing".\r\n\r\nChina, one of the main engines of the world economy, has overtaken Greece at the top of the worry list of global investors, who fret its economy is growing at a much slower pace than the official 7 percent target for 2015.\r\n\r\n"Currently, there is still downward pressure on China''s economic growth," the central bank said in a separate statement.\r\n\r\n"There is also relatively big volatility in global financial markets, which require more flexible usage of monetary policy tools."\r\n\r\nGerman Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said the situation in China would be discussed by G20 nations.\r\n\r\nFutures limit-down\r\n\r\nThe CSI300 index .CSI300 of the largest listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen dropped 7.1 percent on Tuesday, while the Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC fell 7.6 percent to close below the psychologically significant 3,000-point level.\r\n\r\nUnderscoring the panic gripping the retail investors who dominate China''s stock markets, all index futures contracts fell by the maximum 10 percent daily limit, pointing to expectations of even deeper losses.\r\n\r\nThough the PBOC move came after domestic markets had closed, stock markets in Europe jumped, and US stock futures were also given a lift.\r\n\r\nAfter the turmoil in China rocked world equity and commodity markets on Monday, policymakers elsewhere in Asia sought to soothe fears about the broader impact on the global economy.\r\n\r\n"I think it''s important that people don''t hyperventilate about these types of things," said Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott, whose country is heavily exposed to China, the biggest consumer of its commodity exports.\r\n\r\n"It is not unusual to see stock market corrections. It is not unusual to see bubbles burst in particular markets and for there to be some flow-on effect in other stock markets, but the fundamentals are sound."\r\n\r\nThis week''s steep declines have taken Chinese stocks into negative territory for the year to date, although Leland Miller, president of China Beige Book International, pointed out that Chinese equity markets have shown little correlation with the real economy - either on the way up or the way down.\r\n\r\n"Previous boom-bust cycles in Chinese stocks have also shown little or no connection to (apparent) economic performance," said Miller, whose firm provides anecdotal survey information about China based on the Fed''s "Beige Book" model.\r\n\r\nEuropean Central Bank Vice President Vitor Constancio said it was too early for the ECB to respond to China''s market fall.\r\n\r\n"Indications are that what we get out of China is that the economy is not decelerating so much to justify the rout in the stock market," he told journalists on the sidelines of a conference.\r\n\r\nNo rescue?\r\n\r\nWhile there is little evidence that the stock market mayhem has dampened consumer spending so far, concerns about the economy intensified after factory activity shrank at its fastest pace in almost 6-1/2 years and the central bank unexpectedly devalued its yuan currency earlier this month.\r\n\r\nA majority of analysts, however, predicts a continued deceleration - rather than a crash - for China''s economy, and dismisses comparisons with the 2008 Global Financial Crisis or the 1997/98 crisis in Asia.\r\n\r\n"The current panic is essentially ''made in China''. The recent data from other major economies have generally been good and there is little to justify fears of a major global downturn," wrote economists at Capital Economics.\r\n\r\n"China''s recent economic data suggest that growth remains sluggish, but are not weak enough to justify fears of a hard landing."\r\n\r\nSome companies, too, have sought to reassure investors that China''s economy is not about to go over the cliff, with Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook and planemaker Boeing Co making encouraging noises about China on Tuesday.\r\n\r\n<html><body><div class="fb-comments" data-href="http://localhost/newsportal/Newsshow.php?page_n=24" data-width="1000" data-numposts="1"></div></html></body>\r\n\r\n', 0),

A district official gave the death toll as nine, but media reports said as many as 20 people - most of them police - may have died.\r\n\r\nState television reported that the army was mobilised to quell the protests in the low-lying far west of the country close to the border with India.\r\n\r\nThousands of people were protesting in the town of Tikapur against a government-backed plan to include their area in a hilly province, part of a regional overhaul envisaged in a new federal constitution expected to be finalised this month.\r\n\r\nThe protesters, mainly from ethnic Tharu community, are demanding a separate province comprising eight districts in the southwestern plains for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe government and major political parties hope that the new constitution, which divides the nation into seven federal states, will boost economic development in Nepal, which is still reeling from two devastating earthquakes that killed 8,900 people this year.\r\n\r\nBut different ethnic groups have been protesting against the plan and demanding regional autonomy. Four demonstrators have died in the past two weeks in violent protests across Nepal.\r\n\r\nRaj Kumar Shrestha, chief administrator of Kailali district that includes Tikapur, said protesters had defied a curfew and had begun vandalising government buildings.\r\n\r\nShrestha declined to elaborate, but told state television separately that the protesters had attacked the police with an array of sharp-edged weapons. He said nine dead comprised six police and three protesters had been killed.\r\n\r\nKailali is a district in Nepal''s far western region, some 430 km (270 miles) southwest of Kathmandu.\r\n\r\nAt least 53 people were killed in similar protests in Nepal eight years ago, in the worst violence that followed the end of a civil war in 2006.\r\n\r\n<html><body><div class="fb-comments" data-href="http://localhost/newsportal/Newsshow.php?page_n=25" data-width="1000" data-numposts="1"></div></html></body>\r\n\r\n', 0),
(26, 'korea', 'North, South Korea reach agreement to ease tensions', '<img style="float:right; width=76%;margin-left:10px" src="images/Korea.jpg">\r\nUnder the accord reached in the very early hours of Tuesday after more than two days of talks, North Korea expressed regret over the recent wounding of South Korean soldiers in land-mine blasts and Seoul agreed to halt anti-Pyongyang propaganda broadcasts, both sides said.\r\n\r\nNorth Korea also agreed to end the "semi" state of war it had declared. The two sides will hold follow-up talks to discuss a range of issues on improving ties, the joint statement said.\r\n\r\n"It is very meaningful that from this meeting North Korea apologised for the land-mine provocation and promised to work to prevent the recurrence of such events and ease tensions," Kim Kwan-jin, national security adviser to South Korean President Park Geun-hye, told a televised news briefing.\r\n\r\nSouth Korean defence ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said both sides would begin rolling back heightened military postures at noon (0300 GMT), when the loudspeaker broadcasts will formally halt and the North''s state of war status will be lifted.\r\n\r\nPyongyang has previously denied laying the land-mines, and in the statement did not explicitly take responsibility for them.\r\n\r\nThe marathon talks at the Panmunjom truce village inside the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) separating the two Koreas began on Saturday, shortly after Pyongyang''s deadline for the South to halt its propaganda broadcasts or face military action.\r\n\r\n"They both made compromises. South Korea did not get an apology, they got a statement of regret about the injury, which they can spin as an apology," said John Delury of Yonsei University in Seoul.\r\n\r\n"The more important point is maintaining this channel and reopening the relationship. This is hardly going to be easy to implement, but it’s a landmark agreement which lays out a path."\r\n\r\nSeoul and Pyongyang have remained technically in a state of war since the 1950-53 Korean war ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, and hopes for improved relations have repeatedly been dashed over the years.\r\nInter-Korean relations have been all but frozen since the 2010 sinking of a South Korean warship, which killed 46 sailors, that Seoul blames on the North. Pyongyang denies responsibility.\r\n\r\nUnder Tuesday''s deal, the two sides also agreed to arrange reunions of families separated by the Korean War during upcoming autumn holidays and in future.\r\n\r\n"What''s important now is to carry forward specific projects agreed by South and North smoothly through follow-up talks so as to ease tensions between South and North," Park''s presidential office quoted her as saying.\r\n\r\nPark, halfway through her single five-year term, has been largely unsuccessful in her efforts to improve ties with the reclusive and impoverished North.\r\n\r\nLand-mines and loudspeakers\r\n\r\nThe recent escalation in tensions began early this month, when the land-mine explosions in the DMZ wounded two South Korean soldiers.\r\n\r\nDays later, the South began blasting anti-Pyongyang propaganda from loudspeakers along the border, reviving a tactic that both sides had halted in 2004.\r\n\r\nThe standoff reached a crisis point on Thursday when the North fired four shells into the South, according to Seoul, which responded with a barrage of artillery fire.\r\n\r\nPyongyang then made its ultimatum that Seoul halt the broadcasts by Saturday afternoon or face military action, but on that day the two sides agreed to hold talks between top level aides to the leaders of the two countries.\r\n\r\nEven as talks were proceeding, North Korea deployed twice the usual artillery strength at the border and had around 50 submarines away from base, the South''s \r\n\r\ndefence ministry said. South Korea had also increased its military readiness.\r\n\r\nSome of the North''s submarines were detected returning to base, Kim, the South''s defence ministry spokesman, said.\r\n\r\nWashington and the United Nations welcomed the agreement.\r\n\r\n"We''re going to judge the North by its actions," US State Department spokesman John Kirby told a briefing. "It was a very tense several days."\r\n\r\nNorth Korea is under UN and US sanctions because of repeated nuclear and missile tests, moves that Pyongyang sees as an attack on its sovereign right to defend itself.\r\n\r\n<html><body><div class="fb-comments" data-href="http://localhost/newsportal/Newsshow.php?page_n=26" data-width="1000" data-numposts="1"></div></html></body>\r\n\r\n', 0),
(27, 'bangladesh has', 'Bangladesh has a great future because of its energetic, resilient people, says British minister Swayne', '<img style="float:right; width=76%;margin-left:10px" src="images/minister.jpg">\r\n\r\nHis three-day visit also aimed to expand on the UK government’s view on development challenges, and the role of the development partnership.\r\n\r\nSwayne arrived on last Sunday on his first tour of Bangladesh and visited clothing factories, Korail slum and Kurhigram river islands to inspect UK-aided projects\r\n\r\nHis impression was ‘very positive’.\r\n\r\n“I have rarely met a people who are so energetic, resilient and hard-working. We all know how big the odds are for them but they have achieved so much that it’s outstanding.\r\n\r\n“I believe given the evidence of its past, Bangladesh has a very promising future.”\r\n\r\nHe continued: “Wherever I visited, I felt that things were moving. It’s very easy to point out the gaps, the missing parts in such efforts, but progress is markedly obvious.\r\n\r\n“In two decades, Bangladesh has taken great strides despite the difficulties every developing country faces,” said Swayne who worked for the Department for International Development (DfID).\r\n\r\nIt was pointed out that there were several concerns including the nutritional status of people, particularly children, and the weak rule of law; problems Bangladesh has failed to cope with properly.\r\n\r\nThe minister did not deny the challenges in food security management and nutrition status, particularly of the poor, but he argued that much had also been achieved.\r\n\r\n“Twenty years ago, many starved in difficult times and areas, but today starvation is history in Bangladesh. This no longer exists and in my opinion, a great success.\r\n\r\nThe Conservative MP was ready to “agree that low nutrition status continues to be a problem”, but said “it’s also one of the last big problems that Bangladesh faces”.\r\n\r\n“It will eventually win and soon, and that is why Bangladesh is such a great success story.”\r\n\r\nThe former banker navigating the world''s most complex humanitarian issues on the UK''s behalf then went on to give his take on the law and order, and human rights situation.\r\n\r\n"A more complex issue is that of a weak law and order regime due to which several breakdowns are noticed, including what tops the list: ‘extra-judicial killings.’\r\n\r\n“How does high aid volume deal with the problem of such obvious cracks in the system relating to human rights and governance?"\r\n\r\n“We do business with many countries and obviously raise our voice on all weakness that contributes to HR failures. I have said that extra-judicial killing must stop,” said the war veteran who served in Iraq.\r\n\r\n“However, we also don’t think we will deal with the issue that will negatively affect the poor, the marginalised, and the victims.\r\n\r\n“We don’t want the vulnerable to suffer, and so our position is that our priority is to help the underprivileged, whenever and wherever we can, and we condemn extra-judicial killings.\r\n\r\n“We shall support the poor when they need it the most while maintaining our position that we wish to uphold the highest standards of human rights,” Swayne, who supervises security department, further said.\r\n\r\nBangladesh is a major recipient of UK aid, so the point about aid utilisation came up. Do they track the way UK money is spent on various projects?\r\n\r\nSwayne responded: “We are not the sort of a donor that hands over the money and then looks the other way. We have reliable and continuously improving monitoring systems in place...\r\n\r\n“...and the fact that so much has been achieved by almost every project that  we have supported is a good indicator that it’s money well spent. We have confidence in our development partners.”\r\n\r\nIt was also pointed out that the readymade clothing sector was a topic of concern and the pricing and wages were key and connected matters that were often left unattended.\r\n\r\nThe British minister who also oversees working on trade, conflict, humanitarian departments said: “I think it’s a matter of commercial negotiation and both parties will exert their positions as much as possible which benefits both.\r\n\r\n“This is only natural and we encourage this because commercial negotiations work best when both parties benefit.\r\n\r\n“However, from our side we have supported hiring of a large number of supervisory cadres who are working to ensure both fair wages and proper working conditions.\r\n\r\n“I am confident and evidence says so that things are improving and will improve more.\r\n\r\n“Does it mean that the sector has solved the problem? No, it hasn’t. There is a long way to go, but again I would say the first big steps have been taken. Yes, it’s a commercial issue and yes it’s an equity and fairness issue as well and we are focusing on all of them.”\r\n\r\nSpeaking on the future development relations with Bangladesh, the minister said the achievement of the majority of the MDGs is a testament to the journey that Bangladesh was taking on achieving a better future for all.\r\n\r\n“In the post-MDG scenario, many more targets will be set, so it’s an exciting and challenging time and within that frame climate change is a major factor.\r\n\r\nSwayne said: “Bangladesh has played an admirable role in bringing the voice of the most affected countries to the forefront. And it is a model for that kind of international advocacy.\r\n\r\nHe said Britain will “continue to lend our support not just for adaptation projects but mitigation initiatives as well”.\r\n\r\n“We shall be focusing a lot more on governance issues which we think are critical for sustainable development, so the area of interest will in fact increase and so will co-operation.”\r\n\r\nThe DfID minister sounded a note of caution on mobilising domestic resources.\r\n\r\n“Bangladesh can do better and should do better in this. I was assured by the finance minister that much more efforts will be mounted to increase the tax collection level so that Bangladesh is in a better position to reach its development targets more effectively.\r\n\r\n“And so governance development will play a major part in this scheme of things,” said Swayne who taught economics.\r\n\r\n“We will support Bangladesh in every way possible. We shall provide aid, we shall offer the skills that we have, but Bangladesh will have to deliver its political will.\r\n\r\n“Together much can be done on top of what has already been done.”\r\n<html><body><div class="fb-comments" data-href="http://localhost/newsportal/Newsshow.php?page_n=27" data-width="1000" data-numposts="1"></div></html></body>\r\n\r\n', 0),

It is "Hamlet," but not in the brooding Laurence Olivier or Richard Burton tradition.\r\n\r\nThe three-hour-long production directed by Lyndsey Turner at the Barbican Theatre is set for the first half in a palace that looks more like Downton Abbey than Elsinore, while in the second half the same set has been ravaged by war.\r\n\r\nIn this environment, the 39-year-old British film and television star works some of his most famous roles into the DNA of a very modern prince. He at one point wears a hoodie and for most of the play is dressed like a guy from the ''hood - as are his mates.\r\n\r\nDisplaying the quick wit and mental acuity of his television detective "Sherlock," Hamlet figures out that his uncle Claudius, portrayed by a wonderfully two-faced Ciaran Hinds of "Game of Thrones" fame, killed his father, usurped the crown and married his mother (Anastasia Hille).\r\n\r\nThe prince then does his best to alienate everyone around him, especially the young Ophelia (Sian Brooke), whom he deeply loves, a bit like Cumberbatch''s sociopath mathematician Alan Turing does to his colleagues in "The Imitation Game".\r\n\r\nOne thing Cumberbatch''s Dane is not is melancholy. There''s a hilarious scene in the first part where he enters dressed as a drum major and proceeds to dance and drum on a banquet table, before eventually retreating inside a toy fort guarded by four giant-sized toy soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe production tinkers with the text, but "To Be or Not to Be," which in early previews opened the play, sensibly has been restored to its normal spot.\r\n\r\nOther revisions are more subtle, including having Ophelia use some of the dialogue from earlier in the play for the wistful songs she sings just before she drowns herself.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may not be a "Hamlet" for the ages, but it is one for now, and for Cumberbatch''s legions of predominantly female fans.\r\n\r\nSome of those attending Tuesday''s performance said while queuing for day tickets that they were seeing it for the fourth or fifth time. At least one or two were planning to jump back in the queue when the show ended, to see it again.\r\n\r\nThe production will be broadcast to cinemas on Oct 15.\r\n\r\n(Michael Roddy is the Entertainment Editor for Reuters in Europe.

Manjhi died in 2007 in his early 80s.\r\n\r\nDirected by Ketan Mehta, the biopic also stars Radhika Apte and hit the theatres on Friday.\r\n\r\n<html><body><div class="fb-comments" data-href="http://localhost/newsportal/Newsshow.php?page_n=35" data-width="1000" data-numposts="1"></div></html></body>\r\n\r\n<img src="images/dano.jpg">', 0),

From there on, the bowlers realised it''s time to squeeze in now and build up some really good pressure," he added.\r\n\r\nSri Lanka''s day begun in the worst possible fashion when India paceman Umesh Yadav struck with the first ball of the morning which Mathews (23) edged for stand-in wicketkeeper Lokesh Rahul to take a diving, one-handed catch.\r\n\r\nRahul was keeping in place of regular India stumper Wriddhiman Saha, who has been ruled out of the remainder of the series with a hamstring injury.\r\n\r\nMishra struck the next blow, pulling off a classical leg-spinner''s dismissal by bowling Dinesh Chandimal around his legs.\r\n\r\nAshwin and Mishra maintained relentless pressure on the hosts to reduce them to 130-9 when rain brought a premature lunch, but the relief proved short lived as the hosts folded soon after the break.\r\n\r\n"We did not play our best cricket," Mathews rued at the presentation ceremony. \r\n\r\n"More disappointing is we could not do it for Sanga, who deserved to leave the field with a high and a win. We promise him we will play our best in the next game and win it for him."\r\n\r\nRahul, who struck a century in the first innings, was adjudged man of the match.\r\n\r\nAshwin has been equally impressive and with 17 wickets from the first two Tests, he is likely to trouble Sri Lanka again in the third and final Test in Colombo starting on Friday.\r\n\r\nSangakkara, who made 32 and 18 in his 134th and final Test, was given a rousing reception with the Indians shaking hands with him and the former captain being hoisted by his team mates for a round of the stadium as the crowd gave a standing ovation.\r\n\r\n<html><body><div class="fb-comments" data-href="http://localhost/newsportal/Newsshow.php?page_n=36" data-width="1000" data-numposts="1"></div></html></body>\r\n\r\n<img src="images/dano.jpg">', 0);
